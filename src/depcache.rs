//! Dependency Extension data for the cache.
//!
//! The following was taken from libapt-pkg documentation.
//!
//! This class stores the cache data and a set of extension structures for
//! monitoring the current state of all the packages. It also generates and
//! caches the 'install' state of many things. This refers to the state of the
//! package after an install has been run.
//!
//! The StateCache::State field can be -1,0,1,2 which is <,=,>,no current.
//! StateCache::Mode is which of the 3 fields is active.
//!
//! This structure is important to support the readonly status of the cache
//! file. When the data is saved the cache will be refreshed from our
//! internal rep and written to disk. Then the actual persistent data
//! files will be put on the disk.
//!
//! Each dependency is compared against 3 target versions to produce to
//! 3 dependency results.
//!   Now - Compared using the Currently install version
//!   Install - Compared using the install version (final state)
//!   CVer - (Candidate Version) Compared using the Candidate Version
//! The candidate and now results are used to decide whether a package
//! should be automatically installed or if it should be left alone.
//!
//! Remember, the Candidate Version is selected based on the distribution
//! settings for the Package. The Install Version is selected based on the
//! state (Delete, Keep, Install) field and can be either the Current Version
//! or the Candidate version.
//!
//! The Candidate version is what is shown the 'Install Version' field.
