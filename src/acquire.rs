//! File Acquiration
//!
//! The following was taken from libapt-pkg documentation.
//!
//! This module contains the Acquire system. It is responsible for bringing
//! files into the local pathname space. It deals with URIs for files and
//! URI handlers responsible for downloading or finding the URIs.
//!
//! Each file to download is represented by an Acquire::Item class subclassed
//! into a specialization. The Item class can add itself to several URI
//! acquire queues each prioritized by the download scheduler. When the
//! system is run the proper URI handlers are spawned and the acquire
//! queues are fed into the handlers by the schedular until the queues are
//! empty. This allows for an Item to be downloaded from an alternate source
//! if the first try turns out to fail. It also allows concurrent downloading
//! of multiple items from multiple sources as well as dynamic balancing
//! of load between the sources.
//!
//! Scheduling of downloads is done on a first ask first get basis. This
//! preserves the order of the download as much as possible. And means the
//! fastest source will tend to process the largest number of files.
//!
//! Internal methods and queues for performing gzip decompression,
//! md5sum hashing and file copying are provided to allow items to apply
//! a number of transformations to the data files they are working with.
